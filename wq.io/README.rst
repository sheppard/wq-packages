Python libraries for consuming (input) and generating (output) external
data resources in various formats.

Importing data
--------------

The basic process is broken into several steps which are handed by
various submodules.

**loaders**

Load an external resource from the local filesystem or from the web into
a file-like object.

**parsers**

Parse the file (using the standard python library for that file type)
and convert the recordset into a simple list of dictionaries.

**mappers**

Rename field names and values if needed and optionally convert the
dictionaries into other object types (such as a namedtuple).

Traversing data
---------------

The base library then provides a collection object (an "IO") that can be
used to easily navigate the dataset. It also provides a number of
convenience classes for common IO use cases. For example, CsvNetIO
provides an IO with loaders.NetLoader, parsers.CsvParser, and
mappers.TupleMapper pre-mixed into the class.

Exporting data
--------------

The export process uses the same submodules to apply the above steps in
reverse:

**mappers**

Convert the mapped object back into a simple dictionary and map the
field names and values back to the format expected by the file.

**parsers**

Convert the dictionary list back into the source format and write out to
the file.

**loaders**

Prepare the file-like object for writing and perform any needed wrap-up
operations.
